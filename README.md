# NYC Air Quality Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes New York City's air quality surveillance data sourced from the US Data Gov website. The dataset provides insights into the relationship between air pollution and population density across NYC neighborhoods, covering air quality indicators, pollutant emissions, and health implications. The goal is to explore trends in air quality, particularly in the city's most populated boroughs.

## Dataset

The dataset, named "Air_Quality," provides comprehensive information on New York City's air quality. The key attributes include:

- **Air Quality Indicators**: Including pollutant levels and emissions.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Data is categorized by neighborhoods and boroughs.
- **Time Range**: The dataset covers data from 2016 to 2022.

For more details, the data can also be explored on the [Environment and Health Data Portal](http://nyc.gov/health/environmentdata).

## Questions Addressed

1. **Air Quality Levels in the Most Populated Boroughs:**
   - This analysis focuses on the top 5 most populated boroughs in NYC.
   - It examines air quality levels across these boroughs to understand the impact of population density on pollution levels.
   - This question is important because urban areas with higher populations often face greater pollution challenges, impacting public health.

2. **Air Quality Before and After COVID:**
   - The analysis compares air quality levels in the 5 most populated boroughs before and after COVID-19.
   - It aims to assess how the pandemic, which led to decreased vehicular and industrial activities, affected pollution levels.
   - This is significant for evaluating how changes in societal behavior can influence environmental health.

## Data Manipulations

To ensure focused and relevant analysis:

- The dataset was filtered to include only the top 5 most populated boroughs in NYC.
- Data from 2016 to 2022 was used to provide a meaningful time range for comparison.
